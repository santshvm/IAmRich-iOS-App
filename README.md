Recreated the infamous [I Am Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich) app that was sold on the App Store for US$999.99 (equivalent to $1,259 in 2021), €799.99 (equivalent to €934.74 in 2021), and GB£599.99 (equivalent to £818.55 in 2020), the highest price Apple allowed for App Store content. The application was removed from the App Store without explanation by Apple Inc. the day after its release, August 6, 2008.

# Features 

The app absolutely does nothing. Yes! This app was created by me just to get familiar with designing user interfaces in the interface builder using storyboard in Xcode. All the app does is add a blue diamond to the user’s phone’s background with the catchphrase - “I Am Rich".
